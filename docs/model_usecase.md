The choice of a machine learning model is driven by the problem you are trying to solve and the nature of your data. This guide covers a wide range of common use cases and the types of models best suited for them.

## ðŸ§  Supervised Learning: Predicting from Labeled Data

Models learn from data that is already labeled with the correct output.

| Use Case | Which Model to Select | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Classification (e.g., Spam Detection)** | **Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes** | These models are fast, simple, and work well with text data, making them a great starting point for binary or multi-class problems. |
| **Structured/Tabular Data Prediction** | **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) or Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** | This is for standard prediction tasks with tabular data. FNNs (or Multi-layer Perceptrons) can capture complex non-linear patterns, while XGBoost often provides state-of-the-art performance. |
| **Time-Series Forecasting or Text Analysis** | **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or LSTM** | This data is sequential. RNNs and LSTMs are specifically designed with internal memory to process sequences and capture temporal dependencies. LSTMs are better for longer sequences. |
| **Image Recognition / Computer Vision** | **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | CNNs are the standard for grid-like data like images. Their architecture is designed to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns (edges, shapes, objects) efficiently. |
| **House Price Prediction (or other numerical prediction)**| **Linear Regression or Random Forest** | This is a regression task. Linear Regression is a simple baseline, while Random Forest handles non-linearities and interactions between features well. |

## æŽ¢ç´¢ Unsupervised Learning: Finding Hidden Patterns

Models work with unlabeled data to find structures or anomalies.

| Use Case | Which Model to Select | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Segmentation** | **K-Means Clustering** | The goal is to group similar data points. K-Means is a simple and efficient algorithm for partitioning customers into distinct clusters based on their features. |
| **Fraud or Defect Detection** | **Isolation Forest or Autoencoder** | This is an anomaly detection task. Isolation Forest is efficient at isolating outliers, while an Autoencoder can learn a representation of "normal" data and will have a high reconstruction error on anomalies. |
| **Generating Realistic Images or Data** | **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or VAE** | The goal is to create new, synthetic data. GANs use a generator-discriminator competition to produce highly realistic outputs, making them ideal for image generation. |
| **Topic Modeling for Documents** | **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** | The goal is to find abstract topics in text. LDA is a generative statistical model specifically designed to parse documents and group words into topics. |

## ðŸŽ® Reinforcement Learning: Learning Through Trial and Error

An agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward.

| Use Case | Which Model to Select | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Game Playing (e.g., Atari, Chess)** | **Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Policy Gradients (PPO)** | These environments have clear rules and reward signals. DQN is excellent for discrete action spaces, while PPO is robust for more complex or continuous control tasks. |
| **Robotics and Continuous Control** | **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** | Robot control requires continuous actions and safe exploration. PPO and SAC are state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms that are sample-efficient and stable. |
| **Dynamic Pricing or Ad Placement** | **Multi-Armed Bandit or Q-learning** | The goal is to find the best "action" (e.g., price or ad) to maximize a reward (e.g., revenue or clicks). A Multi-Armed Bandit is simple and effective for this. |
