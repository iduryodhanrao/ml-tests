## ðŸ§  Supervised Learning: Predicting from Labeled Data

Models learn from data that is already labeled with the correct output.

| Use Case | Which Model to Select | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Classification (e.g., Spam Detection)** | **Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes** | These models are fast, simple, and work well with text data, making them a great starting point for binary or multi-class problems. |
| **Structured/Tabular Data Prediction** | **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) or Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** | This is for standard prediction tasks with tabular data. FNNs (or Multi-layer Perceptrons) can capture complex non-linear patterns, while XGBoost often provides state-of-the-art performance. |
| **Time-Series Forecasting or Text Analysis** | **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or LSTM** | This data is sequential. RNNs and LSTMs are specifically designed with internal memory to process sequences and capture temporal dependencies. LSTMs are better for longer sequences. |
| **Image Recognition / Computer Vision** | **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | CNNs are the standard for grid-like data like images. Their architecture is designed to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns (edges, shapes, objects) efficiently. |
| **House Price Prediction (or other numerical prediction)**| **Linear Regression or Random Forest** | This is a regression task. Linear Regression is a simple baseline, while Random Forest handles non-linearities and interactions between features well. |

## æŽ¢ç´¢ Unsupervised Learning: Finding Hidden Patterns

Models work with unlabeled data to find structures or anomalies.

| Use Case | Which Model to Select | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Segmentation** | **K-Means Clustering** | The goal is to group similar data points. K-Means is a simple and efficient algorithm for partitioning customers into distinct clusters based on their features. |
| **Fraud or Defect Detection** | **Isolation Forest or Autoencoder** | This is an anomaly detection task. Isolation Forest is efficient at isolating outliers, while an Autoencoder can learn a representation of "normal" data and will have a high reconstruction error on anomalies. |
| **Generating Realistic Images or Data** | **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or VAE** | The goal is to create new, synthetic data. GANs use a generator-discriminator competition to produce highly realistic outputs, making them ideal for image generation. |

## ðŸŽ® Reinforcement Learning: Learning Through Trial and Error

An agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward.

| Use Case | Which Model to Select | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Game Playing (e.g., Atari, Chess)** | **Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Policy Gradients (PPO)** | These environments have clear rules and reward signals. DQN is excellent for discrete action spaces, while PPO is robust for more complex or continuous control tasks. |
| **Robotics and Continuous Control** | **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** | Robot control requires continuous actions and safe exploration. PPO and SAC are state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms that are sample-efficient and stable. |
| **Dynamic Pricing or Ad Placement** | **Multi-Armed Bandit or Q-learning** | The goal is to find the best "action" (e.g., price or ad) to maximize a reward (e.g., revenue or clicks). A Multi-Armed Bandit is simple and effective for this. |

## Details about Classical ML regression models

| Model | Description                 | Pros | Cons | When to Use | Real-world Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | Establishes a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The model finds the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared errors. Coefficients represent the impact of each feature. | Highly interpretable, computationally efficient, easy to implement and understand. | Assumes a linear relationship, sensitive to outliers, can suffer from multicollinearity. | When you have a dataset with a likely linear relationship and need a simple, fast, and interpretable model. | Predicting a company's sales based on advertising spending, forecasting house prices. |
| **Polynomial Regression** | A form of linear regression that models a non-linear relationship as an n-th degree polynomial. It fits a curve to the data, allowing it to capture more complex patterns than a straight line. | Can model non-linear relationships that linear regression can't capture. | Can easily overfit if the polynomial degree is too high, less interpretable than linear regression. | When the relationship is clearly non-linear, but you want to avoid a more complex model. | Modeling population growth over time, predicting the trajectory of a projectile. |
| **Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression** | Regularized linear models that add a penalty term to the linear regression cost function to prevent overfitting. **Ridge** (L2) shrinks coefficients towards zero, while **Lasso** (L1) can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, performing feature selection. **Elastic Net** combines both. | Prevents overfitting, helps with multicollinearity, Lasso performs feature selection. | Difficult to tune the regularization parameter, less interpretable than standard linear regression. | When you have many features, multicollinearity, or are concerned about overfitting in a linear model. Lasso is great for feature selection. | Predicting credit risk with many features, gene expression analysis. |
| **Decision Tree Regression** | Partitions the feature space into a set of rectangular regions. The prediction for a new data point is the average of the training data points in the same region. It makes a series of decisions based on feature values to create these partitions. | Easy to understand and visualize, can handle both numerical and categorical data, requires minimal data preparation. | Prone to overfitting, can be unstable (a small data change can alter the tree significantly), less accurate than ensemble methods. | When you need a simple, interpretable model for complex, non-linear relationships. | Predicting a customer's likelihood to churn, identifying a patient's disease risk. |
| **Random Forest Regression** | An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data and features. It outputs the average of their individual predictions, which reduces overfitting and improves robustness. | Very accurate and robust, less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree, handles a large number of features. | Less interpretable than a single decision tree, computationally more expensive than linear models. | When you need a highly accurate model and interpretability isn't the primary concern. | Predicting housing prices with many variables, forecasting future sales. |
| **Gradient Boosting Machines** | Another ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each new tree correcting the errors of the previous ones. It focuses on difficult-to-predict data points, leading to high performance. XGBoost and LightGBM are popular examples. | Extremely high accuracy, often a top performer in machine learning competitions, handles various data types well. | Can be prone to overfitting if not tuned properly, computationally intensive. | When you need the highest possible prediction accuracy and have enough data to train a complex model. | Predicting user click-through rates, fraud detection, demand forecasting. |
| **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** | An extension of Support Vector Machines for regression. It finds a hyperplane that fits the data points within a certain margin of tolerance. It's effective in high-dimensional spaces and with non-linear data using kernel functions. | Effective in high-dimensional spaces, works well with non-linear data using different kernel functions. | Can be sensitive to the choice of kernel and its parameters, computationally expensive on large datasets. | When you have a small-to-medium dataset with many features and complex non-linear relationships. | Predicting time series data, financial forecasting, bioinformatics. |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression** | A non-parametric model that makes predictions based on the "k" nearest data points in the training set to a new data point. It averages the target values of these neighbors to make a prediction. | Simple to implement, no training phase, can model complex relationships. | Computationally expensive during prediction, sensitive to the scale of features. | When you have a small dataset and want a simple, non-parametric model. | Recommender systems (predicting movie ratings), filling in missing data. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistic Regression** | Despite its name, this is a linear model for classification. It uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to output a probability value between 0 and 1, which is then mapped to a discrete class. It's used for binary classification but can be extended to multi-class problems. | Simple to implement, computationally efficient, easy to interpret the coefficients as they relate to the probability of the outcome. | Assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of the outcome; can be sensitive to multicollinearity. | When you need a fast, simple, and interpretable model for binary classification, and the data is linearly separable or close to it. | Spam detection (spam or not spam), predicting whether a customer will churn (yes or no), medical diagnosis (disease or no disease). |

| **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** | Finds an optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space with the largest possible margin. The data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors. SVM can also use kernel functions to transform non-linear data into a higher dimension where a linear separation is possible.  | Effective in high-dimensional spaces, memory efficient because it uses a subset of training points (support vectors), and versatile with different kernel functions. | Can be computationally expensive on large datasets, performance is highly dependent on the choice of kernel and its parameters. | When you have a small to medium-sized dataset with a high number of features, and you need a powerful model for classification. | Handwriting recognition, text categorization, and bioinformatics. |
| **Naive Bayes** | A family of probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that all features are independent of each other given the class label, which is a strong but often effective assumption. It calculates the probability of a data point belonging to each class and selects the class with the highest probability. | Fast and easy to implement, works well with high-dimensional data, and is often used as a benchmark for other models. | The "naive" assumption of feature independence is often not true in real-world data, which can sometimes lead to suboptimal performance. | When you have a high-dimensional dataset and need a simple, fast, and scalable model, such as for text classification. | Spam filtering (classifying emails as spam or not spam), sentiment analysis, and document categorization. |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification** | A non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the majority class among its "k" nearest neighbors in the feature space. The "distance" between data points can be calculated using various metrics like Euclidean distance. | Simple to implement, no training phase, can be effective with non-linear decision boundaries. | Computationally expensive during prediction, sensitive to the scale of features, and a small number of features with large variations can dominate the model. | When you have a small dataset and want a simple, non-parametric model, and the data is well-structured. | Recommender systems, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. |
