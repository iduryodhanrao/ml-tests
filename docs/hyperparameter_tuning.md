# üìä Online vs. Offline Metrics in Machine Learning

Understanding the distinction between **offline** and **online** evaluation metrics is key to building robust, production-ready ML systems.
- **Offline metrics** help validate model performance before deployment.
- **Online metrics** measure real-world impact and user behavior post-deployment.
- A robust ML workflow uses **both** to ensure reliability, relevance, and business value.
